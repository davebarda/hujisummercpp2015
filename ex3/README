1)There is a difference between the two sets, the smaller one runs alot faster,
moreover relativly the paralellism works alot better on the big file(even that in the + operation
it takes more than the sequential, but relativly).This caused by that the overhead of switching
threads is realtivly more significant at the small file.

2)There is a difference between the operations, the sum is faster on the sequential timing.
It caused by that the sum is alot faster so the overhead of switching threads is relativly more
significant, that is to say at the multipication the time gained by the
parallel computing is more than the time lost by switching threads.
