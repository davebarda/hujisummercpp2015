Usage:
1.Extract ex3_files.tar to the same folder that Matrix.hpp is.
2.Create a folder named SchoolSol at the same folder as Matrix.hpp is and 
extract ex3_schoolSol.tar in it.
3.Run python TestsGenerator.py <num of int tests> <num of double tests> <num of complex tests>
to create random tests(You can change the values of the dimensions at the TestsGenerator.py).
4.Run make Test
5.Run ./Test

3 Folders will be created UserSol/TestsSol SchoolSol/TestsSol and SolDiff.
each one of them contains files named by the next format <Type>_<Operation number>_<Test number>.

Note:
In case that the GenericMatrixDriver will assert you will be informed and the test will be counted as PASSED.
